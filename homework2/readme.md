Homework 2: Linear Regression



In this homework, you will finish the training of a given dataset (data.csv) using linear regression. This homework includes two parts: 

1. Try to finish the key codes in "[LinearRegression.py](./LinearRegression.py)". I think I leaved the blank "TODO" in the key position for you to finish.
2. Try to finish the key codes in "[LinearRegression-scikit-learn.py](./LinearRegression_scikit-learn.py)" using sklearn. You can check the official document of how to use sklearn linear_regression model: [Click here.](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) 

3. Take a look at the course of Andrew NG about Logistic Regression and finish the quiz
